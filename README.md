This repository contains examples of a Python function that has a subtle bug causing a masked ZeroDivisionError, and the solution to fix the problem. The bug is that there's a case where a division by zero could happen but the ZeroDivisionError is masked because the if conditions before the division return a different value. The solution involves restructuring the logic to properly handle the division by zero.
